CROWNSHIRE, Keithieopia ‚Äî New Year's is usually a time of relaxation, but not for the Ministry of Finance, who was busy proofing designs for the new Kruble. 

"Today marks a very important moment for the economy" said the Minister, commenting on the new release of the five, ten, and twenty kruble denominations. 

The one kruble denomination of the currency was first unveiled almost a year ago, and has been on public display for comments since then. The new design is very similar in nature, but with greater contrast.

The Ministry of Finance also released the current exchange rates. ùí¶1 is equivalent to $2.99 USD or ‚Ç¨2.80. Under law, the Kruble is pegged to the cost of a loaf of bread or a two gallon jug of milk, whichever is higher.

The nation's economy now stands at ùí¶148 ($442.52 USD or ‚Ç¨414.40). Government spending is down from prior years, at ùí¶129.62 for year 2022. "Our nation continues to grow, both diplomatically and financially" remarked Emperor Keith.
