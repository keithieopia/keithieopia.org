# About Keithieopia
The Dominion of Keithieopia is an independent and sovereign state located in North America. It operates from a self-proclamed extraterritorial chain of islands. Its shores are several creeks of the Patuxent River in the State of Maryland.



## History
<img class="img" src="/assets/flags/keithieopia.png">
First an autocracy, the founding ideals of the nation were developed mid-November 2002 on *Jennifer Government: NationStates* (the nation was considered a "Father Knows Best State"). The nation at this point was named simply Keithieopia and Keith named himself Benevolent Dictator.

Challenging Keith offline, founding fathers Allen Price and Justin Sloan encouraged Keith to form a proper code of laws for the nation. On January 3rd, 2002, Keith adopted such, officially and formally forming Keithieopia.

### Empire Begins
On July 30th 2006, Keith formed the Empire of Keithieopia, after the nation outlived several smaller nations formed at Keith's school. Those nation's laws and ideals were adopted into the Empire's code of laws. The Empire at this point was an absolute monarchy with a very limited constitution.

### Second Constitution

In 2010, As the Realm's [second constitution](//wiki.keithieopia.org/doku.php?id=second_constitution_of_the_keithieopian_realm) 
was ratified and the code of laws developed, a set of fundamental rights emerged. The Empire was rebranded as a semi-constitutional monarchy named the Keithieopian Realm, due to the sparseness of its land claims at the time: one in Virginia and one in Maryland.

Tragedy struck when the computer that housed the national documents was damaged in transit on route to the Maryland territory, resulting in a loss of the original constitution.

### Current Era

On January 27th, 2021 with the signing of the [current third constitution](/?constitution), the Realm became the Dominion of Keithieopia 
and a constitutional monarchy, limiting the Emperor's powers.

The nation acquired a new domain name, joined Microwiki, and started forming [diplomatic ties](/?foreign_relations) in late December 2022.


## Land

Great care was taken to select land that was overlooked and not claimed by other entities. On December 19th, 2022 
two small isles located (38.4430, -76.4859) and (38.4783, -76.5964) were identified. Again on December 24th, another 
isle was located at (38.6145, -76.5180). 

After much research, the isles were confirmed to not be on any official map nor owned like many other nearby islands. 
Under customary international law, the doctrine of contiguity, and the 1958 Geneva Conventions: a new island would be a 
*res nullius*, or territory owned by no one. A *res nullius* may be claimed through occupation or discovery. 

On December 22th, 2022 the Dominion of Keithieopia publicly and formally [annexed](/?territory#mar-jose-isles) the 
first two, naming them the Isle of Mar and the Isle of Jose. The third island, Ellen Isle, was [annexed](/?territory#isle-of-ellen) 
immediately after it was found. Split Isle lays in close proximity, just above Ellen Isle. Since Split Isle has rightful property owners, it was 
granted [protectorate status](/?territory#split-isle).

Besides the claims to the Isles, the Dominion has two palaces. One is located in the Twin Beaches and is the Imperial Palace (7800 sq. ft / 2377 m<sup>2</sup>), the other is home to Duke Allen and Duchess Jane, the Emperor's parents (3 acres / 12141 m<sup>2</sup>). In total, the Dominion lays claim to 3.19 acres or 12927 m<sup>2</sup> of land.
