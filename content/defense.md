CROWNSHIRE, Keithieopia â€” The Ministry of Defense announced the creation of the Department of Cybersecurity by the National Assembly yesterday. 

The department's formation comes as part of a series of steps to increase the homeland's security after the 
"Faltree Affair"; in which members of the State of Faltree invaded the Dominion's official diplomatic channels about three weeks ago. 

Speaking on the condition of anonymity, a member of the department stated that Hokoria was sympathetic to the Dominion's plight and is expected to provide security services as well as a mutual defensive pact with Suteria.

Considering such, it should come at no surprise that the Dominion opted to join the Defensive Military Organization of Micronations.

In a rare public announcement Emperor Keith stated, "The Dominion, while prohibited from traditional warfare, will take any steps as necessary to provide for the common defense of the nation. Evil doers beware: your time is limited."
