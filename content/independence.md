# Reaffirmation of Independence of the Dominion of Keithieopia

*Whereas* Keith declared he could run a nation better;

*Whereas* founding fathers Allen Price and Justin Sloan encouraged such initiative provided a Constitution and Code of Laws be formed;

*Whereas* Keith realized such request, founding Keithieopia in 2002 and became the first citizen;

*Whereas* Keithieopia was soon recognized by three other micronations;

*Whereas* the population of the Dominion of Keithieopia has quadrupled since it's independence; we make this delaration:
