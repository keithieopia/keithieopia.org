CROWNSHIRE, Keithieopia — A rare sight was seen today when a journalist spotted an unassuming courier carrying a wooden box to the Royal Palace.

The Imperial Guards were on high alert, but were in a receptive mood, and allowed the journalist to snap a picture of the box's contents— the Imperial Crown Jewels.

Seen in the picture is the Empress's tiara, the Emperor's crown, and the old Keithieopian Empire's golden laurel. 

The golden laurel has never been photographed before and was thought to be lost in transit with the First Consitution of the Empire around 2006. 

The Office of the Emperor could not be reached for immediate comment.
