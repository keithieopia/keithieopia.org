# The Ministry
The [Premier](?premier) may choose to delegate their powers into specific areas overseen by Ministers. Under the 
authority of the Emperor, previous Premiers have done just that. 

Traditionally, Ministers are subject-matter experts. While the Premier is term limited, no such limits in the 
Constitution exist for Ministers; they serve until recalled by a Premier. Most Premiers only recall a Minister for 
exceptionally grievous acts. The Ministry allows for stability in the government not seen in other democratic nations.
