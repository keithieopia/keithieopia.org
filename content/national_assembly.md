# The National Assembly

The Dominion's National Assembly is the legislative arm of the government, responsible for hearing bills and 
passing them to the Premier to sign into law. 

The Constitution sets the total number of seats at three times the number of shires. Currently there are 12 
seats in the Assembly.

All laws and amendments are published in the [Keithieopian Journal](//wiki.keithieopia.org/doku.php?id=keithieopian_journal).
