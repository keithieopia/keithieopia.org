# Frequently Asked Questions


## Is this a real country?
The member states of the United Nations have not issued any opinion on the Dominion of Keithieopia being a real state.

It is however considered to be a [micronation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micronation), although we are working 
with the international community to change that.

## What are your territorial claims?
The Dominion of Keithieopia claims the Isle of Mar and the Isle of Jose, both located in creeks off the Patuxent River 
in Maryland, a state in the United States of America.

## Are the Isles really Unclaimed?
Yes and no. 

The Isles do not show up in any real property search. They don't appear on any state or county level map. 
According to the state and county's GIS, it's 100% water in that location. Nonetheless, there's two small islands 
there.

Despite the above, the islands most likely are considered swamp land that falls under the jurisdiction of Maryland's 
Department Natural Resources.

## Can I visit the Dominion?
The Mar-Jose Isles are publicly accessible by boat, you can enjoy the views of Battle Creek and St. Leonard 
Creek and the larger Patuxent River, but we do ask you not to physically step foot on them to protect the natural 
ecosystem.
